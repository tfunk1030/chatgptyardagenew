# UI Improvement Plan for Golf Shot Calculator

## Current Implementation Issues

### Weather Integration
- Weather API is implemented with Tomorrow.io integration but not connected to UI
- Manual weather input exists but lacks automatic updates
- Weather refresh functionality marked as TODO

### Shot Visualization
- Current 3D visualization is overly complex
- Focus is on technical details rather than practical information
- Missing clear visualization of environmental effects

### User Input
- Missing direct input for target distance
- No clear display of adjusted playing distance
- Weather effects on shot distance aren't clearly explained

## Required UI Changes

### Core Functionality
1. Target Distance Input
   - Add simple input field for actual distance
   - Support both yards and meters
   - Quick presets for common distances

2. Automatic Weather Integration
   - Implement automatic weather fetching using existing WeatherAPI
   - Add location detection
   - Keep manual input as fallback
   - Show last update time
   - Add manual refresh option

3. Simplified Shot Visualization
   - Replace complex 3D view with focused 2D visualization
   - Show:
     * Actual vs. playing distance
     * Basic shot trajectory
     * Wind direction and strength
     * Clear distance markers

### Information Display

1. Primary Display
   - Target Distance
   - Adjusted Playing Distance
   - Net Adjustment (+ or -)
   - Simple visual representation

2. Environmental Effects Breakdown
   - Temperature Impact
     * Show effect in yards/meters
     * Explain why (air density)
   - Wind Effect
     * Break down into headwind/tailwind/crosswind
     * Show net impact on distance
   - Altitude Effect
     * Show distance adjustment
     * Explain thin air impact
   - Total Adjustment
     * Clear sum of all effects
     * Percentage change

3. Explanatory Elements
   - Clear explanation of why the shot plays longer/shorter
   - Tips for club selection
   - Confidence rating based on conditions

## Suggested User Flow

1. Initial Load
   - Auto-detect location
   - Fetch current weather
   - Show weather summary

2. Distance Input
   - Enter target distance
   - Select units preference
   - Optional: Select club

3. Results Display
   - Show adjusted distance prominently
   - Display simple visualization
   - Present effects breakdown
   - Provide shot recommendations

4. Updates
   - Auto-refresh weather periodically
   - Allow manual refresh
   - Update calculations in real-time

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backend Integration
- Leverage existing WeatherAPI implementation
- Use current physics engine for calculations
- Maintain current accuracy while simplifying display

### Performance Considerations
- Reduce 3D rendering overhead
- Optimize weather API calls
- Cache recent calculations

### Mobile Considerations
- Ensure responsive design
- Optimize touch interactions
- Simplify visualization for small screens

## Next Steps

1. Immediate Actions
   - Create new distance input component
   - Implement weather API connection
   - Design simplified visualization

2. Short-term Goals
   - Develop new UI components
   - Update data flow
   - Add explanation system

3. Testing Requirements
   - Verify weather integration
   - Validate distance calculations
   - Test user flow
   - Ensure mobile compatibility

## Success Metrics

- Time to get adjusted distance
- User engagement with explanations
- Weather refresh reliability
- Mobile usage statistics
- User feedback on clarity
