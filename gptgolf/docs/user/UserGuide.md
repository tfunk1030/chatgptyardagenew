### Initial Setup
1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Allow location access for local weather data (optional)
3. Select your preferred units (yards/meters)

## Basic Features

### Shot Calculator
The Shot Calculator allows you to predict golf shot trajectories based on various inputs:

#### Input Parameters
- **Club Selection**: Choose from available clubs
- **Ball Speed**: Initial ball speed (mph or m/s)
- **Launch Angle**: Angle of launch in degrees
- **Spin Rate**: Ball spin in rpm
- **Wind Conditions**: Speed and direction

#### How to Calculate a Shot
1. Select your club from the dropdown menu
2. Adjust any parameters if needed
3. Click "Calculate Shot"
4. View the trajectory and results

### Weather Integration
Real-time weather data affects shot calculations:
- Temperature
- Air pressure
- Humidity
- Wind conditions

## Advanced Features
