# Project Improvement Plan

## Summary of Findings

1. **Main Application (`main.cpp`)**:
   - Basic error handling for trajectory calculations.
   - Lack of input validation for parameters.
   - Could benefit from modularization for better readability.

2. **Trajectory Calculation (`trajectory.cpp`)**:
   - Good validation of input parameters and physical quantities.
   - Adaptive timestep logic is well-implemented but could be optimized.
   - Error handling is robust, but logging could be improved for better debugging.

3. **Weather API (`weather_api.cpp`)**:
   - Error handling is present but could be more specific.
   - API key management could be improved for security.
   - Response parsing could benefit from additional validation checks.

4. **Testing (`weather_api_test.cpp`)**:
   - Good coverage of various scenarios, but could use mocking for API calls.
   - Error handling in tests is present but could be more specific.
   - Data initialization utility is useful but could allow for more variability.

## Proposed Plan for Improvements and Debugging

1. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Implement more detailed error messages in `main.cpp`, `trajectory.cpp`, and `weather_api.cpp`.
   - Add logging for errors to facilitate debugging.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Add input validation checks in `main.cpp` for trajectory parameters.
   - Ensure all parameters are within reasonable ranges before calculations.

3. **Modularization**:
   - Refactor `main.cpp` to break down the main function into smaller, more manageable functions.

4. **Optimize Adaptive Timestep Logic**:
   - Review and potentially adjust the constants used for adaptive timestep calculations in `trajectory.cpp`.

5. **Mock API Calls in Tests**:
   - Implement mocking for API calls in `weather_api_test.cpp` to avoid reliance on external services during testing.

6. **Expand Test Data Variability**:
   - Modify the `createTestData` function to allow for more variability in test data.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Add comments and documentation throughout the codebase to improve clarity and maintainability.

8. **Run Tests**:
   - Execute all tests to ensure they pass and identify any failing tests that need to be addressed.

## Follow-Up Steps
- Implement the proposed changes iteratively, starting with the most critical areas (error handling and input validation).
- After making changes, run the tests to ensure everything functions as expected.
- Document any changes made and update the relevant documentation files.
